press ESC would go back to menu ANYTIME

when displaying menu
   enter/s to start the game

when playing
   z for shoots
   x for shield(usable only when energy slot is full, persist untill energy used up)
   arrows for movement
   h for cheat ( player hp is at least 1)
   p for pause
   r for restart

number keys are used for debugging, use at your convenience, but NO guarantee that won't break the prgram states.

most useful ones(for demo) are
	2->enemy_spawn()
	3->++mutiShoot

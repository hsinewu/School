s0(n) pixels = a digit
s1(k) digits = a symbol
s2    symbols = an integral, s2 = h*v/n/k

c1 = how many binary bits a digit can represent
c2 = how many binary bits a symbol can represent
c3 = how many binary bits an integral can represent

d1 = message in digits
d2 = message in symbols
d3 = entire message to be embed

l0 = s0*s1*s2= pixels in total
l1 = s1*s2	 = digits in total
l2 = s2		 = symbols in total
l3 = 1		 = an integral
